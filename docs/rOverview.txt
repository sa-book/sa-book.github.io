Below you find the data and R scripts to replicate all examples from the book. The material was created using R (`version 4.1.2`) and RStudio (`version 2021.09.0+351`).

The files in each zip file are organized in a chapter-specific RStudio project and we use relative paths when referring to the different directories. The top-level directory (reference point for the relative paths) contains most R-Scripts and the `.Rproj` file which can be used to open the project in RStudio. If you change the directory structure or the names of directories you might need adjust the scripts accordingly. It might be also necessary to install additional libraries and (free) software to run some the scripts.

## Data source
The data for examples come from the German Family Panel (pairfam), release 10.0 @ZA5678. A description of the study can be found in @Huinink2011. 

We gratefully acknowledge the permission of the pairfam team to share a reduced version of their data to illustrate all techniques presented in the book with real-world survey data.
