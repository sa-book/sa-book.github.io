# Sequence Analysis - Companion Site

This is the repository for the companion website of our book on "Sequence Analysis". The website was created with the [distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) package using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) and is intended to enhance the use of the book. It hosts the data and code required for reproducing the results (in R) presented throughout the book. Next to plain code files, the companion page provides instructions and some bonus material introducing additional examples and analytical tools. 

Please note that most of the materials on this site are designed to be used in tandem with the book published by SAGE ( pre-order from  [SAGE](https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/sequence-analysis/book272086), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MJCBKC3/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_YDSYM9W43ZEDWMZK27PV), or your ❤️ local bookstore).
